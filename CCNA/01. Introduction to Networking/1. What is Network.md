# What is a Network?

A computer network is a system made up of devices that are connected to each other and can communicate using common standards called the Internet Protocol Suite, or TCP/IP. Through this network, the devices can exchange resources, such as files and printers, as well as access network services.

For example, consider a very simple network that only consists of two computers connected together:

## Simple Network Example
In this example, the two computers are directly connected using a cable. This setup allows both computers to exchange data, but only between these two devices.

Now, what if we want to expand the network to connect more than two computers? In that case, we can use additional networking devices such as **routers**, **switches**, or **hubs** to connect multiple computers together:

## Network Example with a Hub
With a topology like this, all the devices connected to the network can communicate with one another. This is the basic way that computer networking works.

We will go into more detail about **hubs** and **switches** shortly. For now, just remember that these devices act as the central point of the network, where all computers are connected.

# Types of Computer Networks

Here are the most common types of computer networks:

1. **Local Area Network (LAN)**  
   A LAN is typically used within small to medium-sized companies, households, or buildings with limited space.

2. **Personal Area Network (PAN)**  
   A PAN covers a very short range, usually up to 10 meters. A common example of a PAN is a Bluetooth connection.

3. **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**  
   A MAN covers a larger geographical area, such as a city or town.

4. **Wide Area Network (WAN)**  
   A WAN covers an even larger area, such as across states, regions, or even different countries.

5. **Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)**  
   A WLAN is a wireless version of a LAN. It allows both wired and wireless devices to connect to the same network.
