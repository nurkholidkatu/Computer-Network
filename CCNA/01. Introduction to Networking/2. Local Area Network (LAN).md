# Local Area Network (LAN)

The term *Local Area Network* (LAN) is commonly used to describe a network of devices that are located within a limited area, such as a house, office, or building. This type of network is usually able to provide high data transfer speeds (up to 10 Gbps) at relatively low cost. Examples of LANs include a small office network inside a single building or a home network.

A typical SOHO (Small Office/Home Office) LAN usually consists of personal computers, printers, switches, routers, and cables that connect all these devices together.

## Example of a Typical LAN
In a typical LAN setup, two computers are connected to a switch. The switch is then connected to a router, which provides Internet access to the LAN.

# LAN Technologies

Some of the most widely used LAN technologies are **Ethernet**, **Token Ring**, and **FDDI**. Most LANs use **TCP/IP** for communication, and **twisted-pair cabling** is commonly used as the physical medium.

### Ethernet
Among these technologies, **Ethernet** is by far the most popular wired LAN technology. It defines the rules for wiring, signaling, connectors, frame formats, and communication protocols.

### Wireless LAN (WLAN)
In addition to Ethernet, most modern LANs also support **Wireless LAN (WLAN)** technology, defined by the IEEE 802.11 standards. Unlike Ethernet, WLAN uses radio waves instead of cables to connect devices within the network.
